//! This module represents the stage of `chrn` processing where there it may read an entire file, or
//! it may read between `@def` and `@end`. This exists so that if there is serial data within the
//! file, the entire file isn't forced to be loaded into memory, which would be a net negative.
//!
//! IMPORTANT NOTES:
//! This loader does NOT UTF-8 check anything, it merely ensures that the region is valid for chrn's
//! language rules. Only bytes are operated upon. The diagnostics sent expect that users of this
//! data check that the data is valid and react accordingly.
