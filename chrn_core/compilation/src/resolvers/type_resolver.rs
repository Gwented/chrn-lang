//! The reason there's so much code in this one file is because this resolution stage is supposed to
//! handle all deep semantic properties that need tracking machinery, and certain other type
//! resolution based parts.
//!
//! This entire file could very well be split into different resolution stages where now,
//! `TypeContext` is simply a composed set of pure functions that have a check and graph updating stage,
//! but that would also mean that later stages must iterate through all compilation units again,
//! then again, then again depending on the composition which seems wasteful, and is objectively
//! slower, just for the sake of composition. Iteration could be reduced by sorting and then each
//! composed stage goes through the different portions it wants, but that's still more allocations
//! and contexts to account for that don't really NEED to exist.
//!
//! May change in the future but right now this seems reasonable enough, even with the 4K+ LOC
//FIXME: Perf shows ~20mc on avg but jumps to ~120mc at times on same 6 expr file.
// First thought: Probably tied to expr order where, if we have a, b, and c where resolution starts
// at c, that means it has to resolve c, loop, resolve b, loop, resolve b.
// But the odds of the spike are low, and it's doubtful that most of the times it just so happens
// to resolve at a higher part of the tree. Need to at least make the perf check not based off of
// lossy mean
//
// Artisinal hand-coded slop

        // This expression resolution dependency tracking system tracks whether the type or const value is

        // resolving expression, as it is merely a wrapper around the expr for metadata
        // purposes (More info in struct's doc). The `Vec<PendingExpr>` stores all exprs that depend
        // on the pending symbol.
        //
        // Pending exprs register themselves by storing themselves inside the pending symbols list.
        // If we have:
        // ```
        // let a = b
        // let b = 3
        // ```
        // The resolution ends with b being having a const val of 3, and a having no value or type
        // because b wasn't resolved yet. But, when a was seen, a created the `PendingSymbol` for b,
        // then it put itself inside b's pending exprs as `b -> [a]`. If we also had "let c = b"
        // c would check if b is already a pending symbol, see that it is, push itself, with b now
        // having [a, c].
        // After b is seen, and has at least a const type and possibly a const value, b sets `needs_check`
        // to true in `TypeContext`, which is ONLY checked if new information attached to `TypeContext` is
        // found, otherwise it stays false and no checks are done to avoid wasting compute.
        // The loop then goes through all pending symbols, and checks the ones that have at least a
        // resolved type, as to also not waste compute. When the loop gets to b's pending symbol, it
        // finds `a`, which has a `ParentState::Unresolved`, meaning it should have it's resolution
        // attempted since we know `b` can help resolve `a`. Resolution traverses "let a = b" by
        // starting with the root `b`. The resolution ALWAYS starts by resolving the root, because
        // the root is always the pending symbol. Since in this scenario, "let a = b" only have b,
        // that means solving the root intrinsically solves a
        //
        //
        //
        // The ore idea behind this system is that everything uses a tree which ALWAYS start at the
        // root and stop at a `None` point
        // Given:
        // ```
        // let a = b + d // b -> b + d -> None | d -> b + d -> None
        // let b = c + e // c -> c + e -> None | e -> c + e -> None
        // let c = e // e -> None
        // let d = b // b -> None
        // let e = 3 // Const
        // ```
        // Every root has one job, go as far as possible up the tree.
        // If we have "let a = b + c" and `c` is unresolved, b resolves itself, goes b -> b + c, sees
        // that c is unresolved, then stops. If c is resolved, c -> b + c, c sees that both b and
        // itself are resolved, it creates the const value, c -> None, returns. This process
        // involves mutated already stored addresses, so this root's only job is to repair
        // everything that was not yet resolved.

        // (which may be a little bit of over-complication but it works)

        // literal 5, d has a const value AND type. In resolution, a, b and d remain unchanged, but c
        // being set to d is noticed, and d has a const value and const type, which results in the
        // incremental update marking c as both const booleans. Because expressions that were pending
        // inside of pending symbols know how far they went, they are checked. So, c would have b checked,
