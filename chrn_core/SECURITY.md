Config loader rejects any script block/file above 32 KiB in [config_loader](./compilation/src/config_loader.rs). If a file exceeds 32 Kib it is truncated and a warn is given.

Module amount can't exceed MAX_MODULES in [chrn_utils](./chrn_utils/src/lib.rs)
Max diagnostics are controlled by external tooling decisions through `Budget` usage in [source_diagnostic](./chrn_utils/src/source_map/source_diagnostic.rs)
Where possible, loops use `loop_abort!`, maybe convert this into a real error if this was more so a geniune attempt at overloading the system? Right now it just assumes this was an internal bug.
